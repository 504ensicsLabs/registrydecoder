# Registry Decoder

Registry Decoder provides a single tool in which to perform browsing, searching, analysis, and reporting of registry hive contents. All functionality is exposed through an intuitive GUI interface and accommodates even novice investigators.

Registry Decoder also acts as a great resource for new research and experimenting within the registry. To see some ideas of open research areas in the registry analysis and how you can contribute to the project, please see our research page.
